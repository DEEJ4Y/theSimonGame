[This website](https://deej4y.github.io/theSimonGame/) was a challenge as part of [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). It is a digital version of the original Simon Game.

The purpose of this project was to strengthen my knowledge of jQuery and put it into practice.
